That is a lot to do in a short period of time! </p><p>Process: The Company is growing really fast in all aspects, which is great.

The position is located anywhere in North America (it can be remote) although every once in a while we might want you to visit us in Toronto or Vancouver; if you live near one of our North American offices we’ll arrange a desk for you if you’d prefer to have company. The position reports to the Senior Director of Security, Privacy & Compliance.<br><br>Your responsibilities will include:<br><ul><li> Identifying and tracking the remediation of security bugs in our software and systems; </li><li> Document issues and outcomes of security investigations; </li><li> Helping assemble data to prove that a process is functioning (or not functioning) properly; </li><li> Building tooling and automation to speed up and scale our ability to find security problems; </li><li> Occasionally digging through logs or other data to find a problem (don’t worry about becoming a log jockey, we’re looking to make sure we automate these problems away and you’re going to help us do that) </li><li> Assisting your teammates in various initiatives designed to improve our systems, software and operations; and </li><li> Assist in the general operations and activities of the security, privacy and compliance team. <br></li></ul>In addition to domain knowledge and soft skills such as self-direction, collaboration and communication your performance will be evaluated using the following metrics:<br><ul><li> Number of issues identified and reported; </li><li> Number of issues tracked and updated; and </li><li> Timely completion of assigned projects. <br></li></ul><strong>About You </strong> <br><br>You’re opinionated on all things security and can back up that up with knowledge and fact. You compose regular expressions in your head while eating your morning cereal. You laugh at those who buy expensive tools to solve problems you could script in your sleep. You can quote NIST special publications and OWASP Top 10 in the same conversation. You love what you do and you’re committed to the security community. You can’t live without access to a shell because you know GUI’s are slow and can’t be automated; you know that {Python | Ruby | Perl} is the one true language (but we won’t judge if your secret passion is Lisp or PowerShell). You win every argument with data (even ones on twitter) because you can’t graph subjective opinions (okay, you could, but why bother). You love the occasional midnight game of “find the hacker”.<br><br>Even though you’re in the earlier days of your career as a security professional, you are a communicative self-starter who has developed strong analytical skills and has proven experience in driving security issues to close using great process and strong data. You don’t need someone else’s well detailed plan since you scoff at ambiguity and you are adept at building a roadmap by leveraging your experience and resources. You don’t believe security needs to be velocity killing and painful; but one that supports the objectives of the business, users and its customers while being prudent to security, privacy and compliance requirements.<br><br><strong>A Note about Working Remotely </strong> <br><br>If you are a remote worker, we’re eager to support you but we think it important to set expectations up front. Remote working takes a commitment to strong communication, both written and verbal, and going the extra mile to make sure your team knows how you’re bringing value every day. The same expectation applies to people that work from home on occasion too. Our primary operations are based on Pacific Standard Time so be prepared for work days that end when the West Coasters go home.<br><br><strong>You’re An Ideal Candidate </strong> <br><br>The ideal candidate will have experience in at least these areas:<br><ul><li> Bachelor of Computer Science/Engineering Degree or equivalent experience; </li><li> A minimum five (5) years of experience in a security engineering related role; </li><li> Scripting and regular expressions; </li><li> Logging and data analysis; </li><li> Knowledge of various security technologies and infrastructure; </li><li> Working knowledge of AWS; </li><li> Relevant security certifications (one from SANS or ISC2 would be good but we’ll consider others equally). <br></li></ul>Ideal candidates can explain:<br><ul><li> How CVSSv2, CCE, CWE interoperate; </li><li> Why SIEMs suck; </li><li> XSS or SQLi in about two sentences; </li><li> What’s wrong with this “access-list extended block1 permit tcp any any eq www” and how you can make it safe (without changing the rule); </li><li> How to find a vulnerability; </li><li> How to find unusual traffic in a log; </li><li> How they figured out what the words to the rest of this song are: /^([h]{1}|[o]{1}){2}W[^/?AB&D-Z]{1}([ad]{1,3}|[u006E]){3}/g </li><li> What is at the other end of this: UEFEUEFEIHNheSBoZWxsbyB0byBiZW4uc2FwaXJvQHZpc2lvbmNyaXRpY2FsLmNvbSBQQURQQUQ= <br></li></ul><strong>Ready to Join Our Team? </strong> <br><br>If this sounds like the perfect opportunity for you we invite you to apply online now.<br><br>Please note that due to the high volume of applications received only short-listed candidates will be contacted.

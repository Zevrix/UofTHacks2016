Job Title:  Intermediate Software Engineer   $%^& Company Name:  Garner   $%^&   Job Location:  Toronto, Canada Area   $%^&   Job Description:  <p><strong>The position</strong> </p><p>We are seeking a passionate software engineer who is simply looking to excel at her or his profession. </p><p>  </p><p>You have been working in software development for a year or two (or maybe none), and are ready to move to a new position with real responsibility and lots of opportunity to grow. (And competitive compensation and benefits) </p><p>  </p><p>We use Scala, Java, Angular/Javascript and Bootstrap. We practice agile programming, TDD, and continuous integration. It’s handy if you know any or all of these but, really, what actually matters is that you are very smart and a quick learner. </p><p>  </p><p>You like debugging software and solving complex problems that require brain power. You like testing code with code. You never deliver code that is not production ready. </p><p>  </p><p>You are curious and always striving to get better at your profession. You like to experiment with new languages, tools, libraries and apply the knowledge that you gain in your everyday work. </p><p>  </p><p>You like working in a team and you have good communication skills, both written and verbal. If you think of something new, or a better way of doing things, you are not afraid to share it with everyone else. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>Who we are</strong> </p><p>Garner Distributed Workflow is a small software company with a close but diverse group of seasoned developers. Some of us have been doing software development for more than 20 years and some others graduated just last year. The development team uses a mix of practices from XP, Agile and other methods like Planning Games, Sustainable Pace, Retrospectives, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Static Code Analysis, Code Reviews, Automated Acceptance and System Integration Testing, Contextual Design, Refactoring, Test-Driven Design, and Pair Programming. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>What we like</strong> </p><p>We prefer people who think critically for themselves and show initiative. We like people who can say “I've made a mistake” and actually learn from it. We value diversity at every level and in every form. </p><p>  </p><p>We strive for continuous improvement at any level (organization, technology and practices). We like to experiment with new things, but we don't throw away what's good about what we have already done. </p><p>  </p><p>We like people to take responsibility for things, and we are ready to give them as much responsibility as they can handle. We believe in pay based on value delivered, not on years of experience. </p><p>  </p><p>We believe in code quality and in hybrid object oriented / functional approaches. We think that code is design. We think that ultimately, code quality and software engineering are the primary contributing factors to cost efficiency. </p><p>  </p><p>We believe in collaboration and adaptation. We know that things change, and plans age very soon, but continuous planning is the key. </p><p>  </p><p>We like to throw a joke around or talk about the latest movie or whatever fancies everyone’s mind, and we certainly care about our company paid Monday lunch and refreshments on Friday afternoon. We hope that you can join us soon so that you won’t miss our awesome party in December. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>What we don't like</strong> </p><p>We don't do long meetings. We don't like overhead and inefficiencies. We hate bureaucracies and office politics. We hate to spend time on manual tasks that can be automated. We can't stand consciously reckless or incompetent behaviour. We know that multitasking is detrimental to our productivity and we avoid it as much as possible. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>Desired Skills & Experience</strong> </p><p>We don't think that looking for a list of buzzwords with X number of years of experience is an effective way to hire people. However, we are definitely looking for a good understanding and working knowledge of at least one of the following: Java, Ruby, Scala, or Clojure. </p><p>  </p><p>In addition to that, knowing any of the following technologies and concepts would definitely be worth mentioning, although not necessary: </p><ul><li>AJAX, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap </li><li>Shell scripting </li><li>Apache Tomcat and Play </li><li>PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2 and HSQLDB </li><li>Any major ORM framework (Slick, Hibernate, iBatis, ActiveRecord, etc.) </li><li>Hudson/Jenkins </li><li>Continuous Delivery </li><li>WebDriver and asynchronous web testing </li><li>Static code analysis, software engineering metrics<p> </p></li></ul><p><strong>The location</strong> </p><p>We are located in Downtown Toronto at Queen West & Spadina, in an informal and vibrant neighbourhood at walking distance from the Entertainment District.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="company-module" class="company-module container" itemprop="hiringOrganization" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><h2 class="container-header">About this company</h2><span class="hiring-org-name" itemprop="name">Garner</span><div id="follow-company-container" class=""><a href="/jobs2/view/actions/unfollowCompany/2223229?csrfToken=ajax%3A8938898238107183324" data-trk="job_view_company_unfollow" class="follow-button stop-following"><span class="following-message">Following company</span><span class="unfollow-message">Unfollow company</span></a><a href="/jobs2/view/actions/followCompany/2223229?csrfToken=ajax%3A8938898238107183324" data-trk="job_view_company_follow" class="follow-button start-following">Follow company</a></div><div class="content"><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description"><p>Garner's Exdocs software reduces construction costs and risks by structuring and sharing logistics data among project owners, engineering companies, freight forwarders, transportation companies and government agencies in large capital projects like mines, pipelines, and oil sands operations.</p></div><div id="activity-feed" class="activity-feed"></div></div></div><div class="

Job Title:  Senior Software Engineer   $%^& Company Name:  Garner   $%^&   Job Location:  Toronto, Canada Area   $%^&   Job Description:  <p><strong>The position</strong> </p><p>We are seeking a passionate software engineer who is simply looking to excel at her or his profession. </p><p>  </p><p>You have been working in software development for several years, and you think you grasp all its dimensions quite well. Furthermore, you are ready to move to a new position where you will be completely empowered, with real responsibility, tough challenges, and lots of opportunity to grow. (And competitive compensation and benefits) </p><p>  </p><p>We use Scala, Java, Angular/Javascript and Bootstrap. We practice agile programming, TDD, and continuous integration. We expect you to have a decent understanding of what it means to develop modern applications for the Web. It’s handy if you know any or all of these but, really, what actually matters is that you are very smart and a quick learner. </p><p>  </p><p>You like debugging software and solving complex problems that require brain power. You like testing code with code. You never deliver code that is not production ready. You are not afraid of dealing with code that has been in production for years and improving it gives you a deep satisfaction. </p><p>  </p><p>You are curious and always striving to get better at your profession. You know that you will work in a totally different way 10 years from now and you are not scared by that. You like to experiment with new languages, tools, libraries and apply the knowledge that you gain in your everyday work. </p><p>  </p><p>You like working in a team and you have good communication skills, both written and verbal. If you think of something new, or a better way of doing things, you are not afraid to share it with everyone else. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>Who we are</strong> </p><p>Garner Distributed Workflow is a small software company with a close but diverse group of seasoned developers. Some of us have been doing software development for more than 20 years. The development team uses a mix of practices from XP, Agile and other methods like Planning Games, Sustainable Pace, Retrospectives, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Static Code Analysis, Code Reviews, Automated Acceptance and System Integration Testing, Contextual Design, Refactoring, Test-Driven Design, and Pair Programming. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>What we like</strong> </p><p>We prefer people who think critically for themselves and show initiative. We like people who can say “I've made a mistake” and actually learn from it. We value diversity at every level and in every form. </p><p>  </p><p>We strive for continuous improvement at any level (organization, technology and practices). We like to experiment with new things, but we don't throw away what's good about what we have already done. </p><p>  </p><p>We like people to take responsibility for things, and we are ready to give them as much responsibility as they can handle. We believe in pay based on value delivered, not on years of experience. </p><p>  </p><p>We believe in code quality and in hybrid object oriented / functional approaches. We think that code is design. We think that ultimately, code quality and software engineering are the primary contributing factors to cost efficiency. </p><p>  </p><p>We like to learn new things, and we don't give up when we want to improve something but a solution is not obvious. We like to develop our own frameworks, but we are willing to get rid of them when we find a more viable solution in the FOSS world. From time to time we also like to contribute back FOSS code. </p><p>  </p><p>We believe in collaboration and adaptation. We know that things change, and plans age very soon, but continuous planning is the key. </p><p>  </p><p>We like to throw a joke around or talk about the latest movie or whatever fancies everyone’s mind, and we certainly care about our company paid Monday lunch and refreshments on Friday afternoon. We hope that you can join us soon so that you won’t miss our awesome party in December. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>What we don't like</strong> </p><p>We don't do long meetings. We don't like overhead and inefficiencies. We hate bureaucracies and office politics. We hate to spend time on manual tasks that can be automated. We can't stand consciously reckless or incompetent behaviour. We know that multitasking is detrimental to our productivity and we avoid it as much as possible. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>The location</strong> </p><p>We are located in Downtown Toronto at Queen West & Spadina, in an informal and vibrant neighbourhood at walking distance from the Entertainment District. </p><p>  </p><p><strong>Desired Skills & Experience</strong> </p><p>We don't think that looking for a list of buzzwords with X number of years of experience is an effective way to hire people. However, we are definitely looking for a good understanding and working knowledge of at least one of the following: Java, Ruby, Scala, Python, or Clojure. </p><p>  </p><p>In addition to that, knowing any of the following technologies and concepts would definitely be worth mentioning, although not necessary: </p><ul><li>AJAX, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap </li><li>Shell scripting </li><li>Apache Tomcat and Play </li><li>PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2 and HSQLDB </li><li>Any major ORM framework (Slick, Hibernate, iBatis, ActiveRecord, etc.) </li><li>Hudson/Jenkins </li><li>Continuous Delivery </li><li>WebDriver and asynchronous web testing </li><li>Static code analysis, software engineering metrics</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div id="company-module" class="company-module container" itemprop="hiringOrganization" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><h2 class="container-header">About this company</h2><span class="hiring-org-name" itemprop="name">Garner</span><div id="follow-company-container" class=""><a href="/jobs2/view/actions/unfollowCompany/2223229?csrfToken=ajax%3A8938898238107183324" data-trk="job_view_company_unfollow" class="follow-button stop-following"><span class="following-message">Following company</span><span class="unfollow-message">Unfollow company</span></a><a href="/jobs2/view/actions/followCompany/2223229?csrfToken=ajax%3A8938898238107183324" data-trk="job_view_company_follow" class="follow-button start-following">Follow company</a></div><div class="content"><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description"><p>Garner's Exdocs software reduces construction costs and risks by structuring and sharing logistics data among project owners, engineering companies, freight forwarders, transportation companies and government agencies in large capital projects like mines, pipelines, and oil sands operations.</p></div><div id="activity-feed" class="activity-feed"></div></div></div><div class="

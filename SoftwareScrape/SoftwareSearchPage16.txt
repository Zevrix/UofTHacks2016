Job Title:  Software Developer Intern, MS/PhD, Summer 2016   $%^& Company Name:  Google   $%^&   Job Location:  Kitchener, ON, Canada   $%^&   Job Description:  <strong>Applications are due by February 29, 2016 at 11:59pm PST. Our team will review applications on a rolling basis and it's in the candidates best interest to apply early. All hiring will be complete by April 2016. Thank you for your patience while we consider your application.</strong><br><br>Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google’s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to tackle new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.<br><br>As a key member of a small and versatile team, you design, test, deploy and maintain software solutions.<br><br>Software Developers at Google are researchers and developers who yearn to create and implement complex computer science solutions. Our developers develop massively scalable, distributed software systems and also collaborate on multitudes of smaller projects that have universal appeal - which requires research, awareness, interactivity, and asking questions. You build strong competencies in data structures and algorithms, along with a technical fascination for how stuff fits together. You need to have a solid foundation in computer science in order to consistently come up with new ideas as well as strive for a deep understanding of our products and services in order to continually improve upon them. We focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of developers with the highest levels of technical depth, programming skills and a keen eye for quality. <br><br>As a Software Developer, you will work on our core products and services as well as those who support critical functions of our engineering operations. Depending on your background and experience, you will be working in one of the following areas: <br><br><strong>Product and Systems Development</strong><br><br>Whether it's finding new and innovative ways to advance search quality, building computing platform and networking technologies, automating the indexing of videos, or continuing to refine and scale complex auction systems (just to name a few), you will be developing solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems out there. You will research, conceive and develop software applications to extend and improve on Google's product offerings and collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data and information. Examples of specialist domains: UI development with AJAX and similar technologies, security, embedded systems and mobile apps (Android), developer tools (IDEs, large-scale build systems, compilers). <br><br><strong>Engineering Productivity</strong><br><br>As a software developer in the Engineering Productivity organization, you'll use your software design, analysis and programming skills to create innovative automated testsystems. This isn't a job in which you'll simply debug and run test cases, in fact that only scratches the surface. The test team undertakes a broad range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent systems that can explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never been done before. There are no text books that can help you learn this, which is why we have some of the best and brightest developers working in this group. <br><br><strong>Site Reliability</strong><br><br> Software developers working in Site Reliability are involved in every facet of Google's production and work on the cutting edge of cloud-based computing. As a member of this elite team you are in the thick of everything involved with keeping Google running, from code-level troubleshooting of traffic anomalies to maintenance of our most cutting edge services; from monitoring and alerts to building new automation infrastructure. Software developers on this team love to create robust and scalable software that scale to tens of millions of users. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day, and work with just about every other engineering and operations team to provide services and applications that are quintessentially Google - fast, reliable and accessible to all. <br><br>Responsibilities<br><ul> <li>Perform specific responsibilities which vary by project area</li> </ul><br><br>Minimum qualifications<br><ul> <li>Currently pursuing a Master's or PhD degree in Computer Science or related technical field.</li><li>Must be currently enrolled in a full time degree program and returning to the program after the completion of the internship.</li> </ul><br><br>Preferred qualifications<br><ul> <li>Experience in systems software or algorithms.</li> <li>Familiarity with TCP/IP and network programming.</li> <li>Knowledge of Unix/Linux or Windows environments and APIs.</li> <li>Excellent implementation skills (C++, Java, Python).</li> </ul><br><br>Area<br><br>Google is and always will be an engineering company.

Job Title:  Software Developer Intern, MS/PhD, Summer 2016   $%^& Company Name:  Google   $%^&   Job Location:  Montreal, QC, Canada   $%^&   Job Description:  Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google’s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to tackle new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.<br><br>As a key member of a small and versatile team, you design, test, deploy and maintain software solutions.<br><br>Software Developers at Google are researchers and developers who yearn to create and implement complex computer science solutions. Our developers develop massively scalable, distributed software systems and also collaborate on multitudes of smaller projects that have universal appeal - which requires research, awareness, interactivity, and asking questions. You build strong competencies in data structures and algorithms, along with a technical fascination for how stuff fits together. You need to have a solid foundation in computer science in order to consistently come up with new ideas as well as strive for a deep understanding of our products and services in order to continually improve upon them. We focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of developers with the highest levels of technical depth, programming skills and a keen eye for quality. <br><br> As a Software Developer, you will work on our core products and services as well as those who support critical functions of our engineering operations. Depending on your background and experience, you will be working in one of the following areas: <br><br><strong>Product and Systems Development</strong><br><br>Whether it's finding new and innovative ways to advance search quality, building computing platform and networking technologies, automating the indexing of videos, or continuing to refine and scale complex auction systems (just to name a few), you will be developing solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems out there. You will research, conceive and develop software applications to extend and improve on Google's product offerings and collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data and information. Examples of specialist domains: UI development with AJAX and similar technologies, security, embedded systems and mobile apps (Android), developer tools (IDEs, large-scale build systems, compilers). <br><br><strong>Engineering Productivity</strong><br><br>As a software developer in the Engineering Productivity organization, you'll use your software design, analysis and programming skills to create innovative automated testsystems. This isn't a job in which you'll simply debug and run test cases, in fact that only scratches the surface. The test team undertakes a broad range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent systems that can explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never been done before.

And then in a click, you share them across your organization. <br><br>All the things you wished you could do with business intelligence -work with huge data live or in-memory, mash up data sources, visualize data in multiple ways, build dashboards, create interactive data applications-are not only possible in Tableau but are also quick work. Cindy Sedlacek, Director at Cornell University, said "We do 10 times the analysis in half the time, with half the staff." The ROI gains are astounding. <br><br>Playdom, Wells Fargo, Zynga, eBay, & thousands more companies use Tableau Software's rapid-fire business intelligence to do fast, ad hoc analysis on any data. From web analytics to labor productivity, it's the way thousands of companies go from frustration to insight.</div><div class="media"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/media/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVqAAAAJDBlODgzNzg5LTkxYjItNDMwZC1hZTU4LTZkZmM1ODVjYTAzNw.png"/></div><div id="activity-feed" class="activity-feed"></div><div class="other-jobs"><h2>Other jobs at Tableau Software, Inc.</h2><ul class="internal-jobs"><li class="internal-job"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/96596794?trk=job_view_company_other_jobs" class="title" rel="nofollow">Quality Assurance Engineer, Sustaining</a><div class="location">Vancouver, BC</div></li><li class="internal-job"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/75013114?trk=job_view_company_other_jobs" class="title" rel="nofollow">Manager, User Experience</a><div class="location">Vancouver, British Columbia</div></li><li class="internal-job"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/87824387?trk=job_view_company_other_jobs" class="title" rel="nofollow">Senior Manager, Engineering</a><div class="location">Vancouver, British Columbia</div></li></ul><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tableau-software/careers?trk=job_view_company_see_more_jobs" class="see-more">View more jobs at Tableau Software, Inc.</a></div></div></div><div class="

Its focus was the provision of an extensive product and service line card from which end users could choose the necessary SKU’s of managed services, hardware, software and engineering services to satisfy their needs. Jolera combined these products with an award winning personalized, professional customer service; a winning formula which led to significant year over year growth. <br><br>Some years back, however, we realized that our business model needed fine-tuning. Our rapid growth put undue pressure on our sales teams. We were hard pressed to keep our promises, and most critically our clients told us we were behaving like “all the other MSP’s.” And so with the objective of retaining the best of “smaller Jolera”, we transitioned from a direct to the end-user seller of services and products to a channel based seller. Jolera would now be able to focus on what it did best, network architecture and IT solution service and delivery, and allow our channel partners to do what they did best, sales, finance, and CRM.<br><br>We invested millions in R&D, re-tooled, re-engineered and re-oriented ourselves on this “new” strategic path. Our products were redesigned to stand alone as separate white labeled SKU’s. We could offer our reseller partners unique business packages which they, in turn, could market as they saw fit. We could still be the Jolera of old, but we could now focus on a more “contained” client base.</div><div id="activity-feed" class="activity-feed"></div></div></div><div class="

Job Title:  Senior Software Development Engineer   $%^& Company Name:  Amazon   $%^&   Job Location:  Vancouver, BC   $%^&   Job Description:  Amazon.com stores and sells millions of unique items worldwide through its Fulfillment Centers (FCs). These items are shipped from tens of thousands of vendors into the many FCs in the Amazon network. We need different quantities of each of these items, we need to pick them up from the vendors at different times, and bring it into the FCs at specific times depending on the priority of the items. Each item has different dimensions, volume and weight and hence is associated with different shipping costs. What we end up with is a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, carrier hubs, Amazon.com FCs and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And we need to do all of this while incurring the least cost.<br><br><br><br>What this results in is an extremely challenging optimization problem, that could be solved using OR techniques, or graph theoretic approaches or any other methodology. A small enhancement in the algorithms of scheduling and optimization can result in millions of savings in transportation cost, or in reducing the amount of inventory that Amazon.com holds.<br><br><br><br>As a Software Development Engineer (SDE) working on the team, you will not only be responsible for creative input into these algorithms, and developing them in an Object Oriented and scalable way, but, you will also spearhead the development of these modules in such a way that they can be packaged and sold to third-party customers as well.

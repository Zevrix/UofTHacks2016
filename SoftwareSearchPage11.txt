These systems should be tested without the application (as the interface to the data).</li> <li>System Testing</li> <li>System testing should focus on any target requirements that can be traced directly to use cases (or business functions), and business rules. The goals of these tests are to verify proper data acceptance, processing, and retrieval, and the appropriate implementation of the business rules.</li> <li>Load Testing</li> <li>Load testing measures subject the system-under-test to varying workloads to evaluate the systems ability to continue to function properly under these different workloads. The goal of load testing is to determine</li> <li>and ensure that the system functions properly beyond the expected maximum workload. Additionally, load testing evaluates the performance characteristics (response times, transaction rates, and other time sensitive issues).</li> <li>Stress Testing</li> <li>Stress testing is intended to find errors due to low resources or competition for resources. Low memory or disk space may reveal defects in the software that aren't apparent under normal conditions. Other defects might result from competition for shared resources like database locks or network bandwidth. Stress testing identifies the peak load the system can handle.</li> <li>Security and Access Control Testing</li> <li>Security and access control testing focus on two key areas of security:</li> <li>Application security, including access to the data or business functions, and system security, including logging into / remote access to the application</li> <li>Application security which ensures that, based upon the desired security, users are restricted to specific functions or are limited in the data that is available to them. For example, everyone may be permitted to enter data and create new accounts, but only managers can delete them. If there is security at the data level, testing ensures that user type one can see all customer information, including financial data, however, user type two only sees the demographic data for the same ministry. System security ensures that only those users granted access to the system are capable of accessing the application and only through the appropriate gateways.</li> <li>Configuration Testing</li> <li>Configuration testing verifies operation of the software on different software and hardware configurations. In most production environments, the particular hardware specifications for the Client workstations, network connections and database servers vary. Client workstations may have different software loaded (e.g. applications, drivers, etc.) and at any one time many different combinations may be active and using different resources.</li> <li>Required Skills and Experience include:</li> <li>5 or more years of experience as a Systems Testing/QA Specialist</li> <li>Demonstrated experience in all functions of system testing involving Java and Oracle database technologies;</li> <li>Demonstrated knowledge and understanding of testing methods in an object-oriented environment;</li> <li>Demonstrated experience in understanding and use of OLTP data model based database;</li> <li>Ability to identify, trace, isolate and replicate problems and successfully conduct root cause analysis as required;</li> <li>Experience in reviewing system requirements in ensuring the QA Test Cases are adequately covered;</li> <li>Experience in documenting in detail the QA Test Cases, and other related QA artifacts;</li> <li>Experienced with using defect management tools for QA/QC work (e.g. Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM) or similar tools);</li> <li>Experience in managing defect reporting and resolution during the defect cycle, this includes working with the user acceptance test lead to report and resolve defects in a timely manner;</li> <li>Experience with SQL tools required in working the Oracle database;</li> <li>Demonstrated experience in development of test plan and reusable test cases; and</li> <li>Excellent analytical and interpersonal skills; excellent English language verbal and written communication skills.</li> <br><br></ul>Like what you see?<br>Apply now!<br><br></div></div></div></div><div id="company-module" class="company-module container" itemprop="hiringOrganization" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><h2 class="container-header">About this company</h2><span class="hiring-org-name" itemprop="name">Procom</span><div class="content"><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">Procom is one of North America’s leading staffing and contract workforce services providers.
